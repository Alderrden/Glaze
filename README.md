# Glaze
Experimental Auto-Generated Python bindings for OpenGL, created with
Cython and [Glad](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/glad)

## Status
(Not working yet)

* The GL backend generates and compiles, but is untested.
Some platform-specific typedefs are ommited, along with the 
functions that use them.

* Other backends such as GLX or EGL are generated partially.
Won't compile.
